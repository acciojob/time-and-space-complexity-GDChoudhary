<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of computer time it takes to run an algorithm.Efficient time complexity.</p>
	<p><b>space complexity</b> is often expressed asymptotically in big O notation, such as O(n),{\displaystyle O(n),} O(nlogn),{\displaystyle O(n\log n),} O(nÎ±),{\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha }),} O(2n),{\displaystyle O(2^{n}),} etc., where n is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity.</p>
